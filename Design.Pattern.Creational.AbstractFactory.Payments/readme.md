**Abstract Factory Pattern Program**

This is an example program of the abstract factory pattern in C#. The program demonstrates how the abstract factory pattern can be used to create different types of payment authorization and transfer objects for two different payment systems - Credit Card and PayPal.

**Abstract Products**

The program defines two interfaces as abstract products:

- IPaymentAuthorization: Defines the contract for payment authorization.
- IPaymentTransfer: Defines the contract for transferring the payment amount.

**Concrete Products for Credit Card**

The program provides two concrete classes that implement the abstract products for the Credit Card payment system:

- CreditCardAuthorization: Implements payment authorization via Credit Card.
- CreditCardTransfer: Implements payment transfer via Credit Card.

**Concrete Products for PayPal**

The program provides two concrete classes that implement the abstract products for the PayPal payment system:

- PayPalAuthorization: Implements payment authorization via PayPal.
- PayPalTransfer: Implements payment transfer via PayPal.

**Abstract Factory**

The program defines an interface IPaymentFactory as the abstract factory. This interface declares methods for creating instances of the abstract products:

- CreateAuthorization(): Creates an instance of the IPaymentAuthorization object.
- CreateTransfer(): Creates an instance of the IPaymentTransfer object.

**Concrete Factories**

The program provides two concrete factory classes:

- CreditCardPaymentFactory: Implements the IPaymentFactory interface for creating objects related to Credit Card payments.
- PayPalPaymentFactory: Implements the IPaymentFactory interface for creating objects related to PayPal payments.

**Client Code**

The program contains a PaymentProcessor class that represents the client code. This class takes an instance of the abstract factory as a constructor argument and uses it to create concrete product objects and process payments.

**Testing the Program**

In the Main method of the Program class, two payment scenarios are tested. First, a payment is processed using the Credit Card payment system, and then a payment is processed using the PayPal payment system. Each scenario demonstrates how the abstract factory pattern provides a unified interface to create compatible objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Conclusion**

The abstract factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to create objects without having to know the specific class of the objects they create, promoting loose coupling and easy extensibility.
